          The universe is a vast expanse of space and time. We constantly try to
          learn more about the universe and make sense of it. Yet, our knowledge
          of the universe is far lesser than what we don’t know about it.
          However, among the few things we know is that there are some
          constants. The first is change; the Greek philosopher, Heraclitus of
          Ephesus, said – “the only constant in life is change”. Change takes
          place naturally, or we bring it about. Therefore, things today are not
          the same as they were ten years ago. Similarly, things were different
          ten years ago from how they were 20 years ago.

          We can only understand it. Time is an artificial construct. That is,
          even though we did not "invent" time. We have recognized it and given
          it meaning. This construct comes from man's need to make sense of
          everything around us. Keeping track of time has helped us immensely.
          It has given us schedules to follow and deadlines to keep up with.
          Another side-effect of time is age. We as humans have recognized that
          as time passes, we and the things around us age.
