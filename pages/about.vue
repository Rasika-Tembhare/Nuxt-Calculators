            Most calculators use the western age system to calculate oneâ€™s age.
            That is, it follows the assumption that the person will turn one
            year only after they reach their birthday the next year. According
            to this system, a person born on 10th January 2014 will turn one
            year old on 10th January 2015. Then, every year they reach 10th
            January, they will be one year older. Hence, they will be ten years
            old as of 10th January 2024, 25 years old as of 10th January 2039
            and so on.

            This is the most common way to calculate age and is used
            universally. Hence, online age calculators use this method to
            calculate one's age. However, different cultures have different ways
            of calculating one's age. For example, in Chinese and Korean
            cultures, a person is one year old the day they are born. In Chinese
            culture, the person turns a year older on the day of the Chinese New
            Year rather than the day they were born.

            For example, if one were born just one day before the Chinese New
            Year, two days later, the baby would be two years old, even though
            the baby is only two days old. Similarly, Koreans count themselves
            one year older every Korean New Year. Hence, a baby born one day
            before the Korean New Year will be two years old on the day of the
            Korean New Year.

            While there are not as many age calculators available online to
            calculate one's age using these systems, some still allow you to
            calculate your age in Korean or Chinese years.

            The above age calculators are used to calculate the years we have
            lived. But what's life without a little bit of fun? Humans love to
            tinker with things and mess around a little bit. Hence, a few age
            calculators are made where we can play around with our age and
            compare them to other things. Some of these age calculators include:
