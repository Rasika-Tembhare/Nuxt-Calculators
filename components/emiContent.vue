        About EMI
      </h2>
      <p>
        The amount owed to the bank or other financial institution each month
        until the loan balance is entirely repaid is known as the Equated
        monthly installment, or EMI for short. It includes a portion of the
        principle that must be returned and the loan's interest. The duration,
        or the number of months, during which the loan must be repaid, is
        determined by dividing the sum of the principal and interest by tenure.
        Monthly payments are required for this sum. The interest portion of the
        EMI would initially be higher and shrink with each payment. The interest
        rate determines the specific portion allocated to principal repayment.
        While the amount of principal and interest components in your monthly
        EMI payment won't alter, it will over time. You'll put more money toward
        the principle and less toward interest with each additional payment.

        How is EMI determined?
      </h2>
      <p>The formula for calculating EMI is as follows:</p>
      <p>P x R x (1+R)^N / [(1+R)^N-1]</p>
      <p>P = The loan's principal amount.</p>
      <p>R is the interest rate.</p>

        How Does the EMI Calculator Work?
      </h2>
      <p>
        EMI Calculator is quick, simple, and intuitive to grasp, with colorful
        charts and rapid results. Using this calculator, you may determine the
        EMI for a house loan, vehicle loan, personal loan, school loan, or any
        other fully amortizing loan.
      </p>
      <p>Fill out the EMI Calculator with the following data:</p>
      <li>Your desired principal loan amount (rupees)</li>
      <li>loan period (months or years)</li>
      <li>Interest rates (percentage)</li>
      <li>EMI in arrears OR EMI in advance (for car loans only)</li>
      <p>
        To change the settings in the EMI calculator form, use the slider. Then,
        you can simply input the values in the pertinent areas if you need to
        provide more accurate numbers. The EMI calculator will update your
        monthly payment (EMI) amount as soon as the settings are modified using
        the slider (or after putting the values straight into the input fields
        by pressing the "tab" key).
      </p>
      <p>
        A pie chart also depicts the breakdown of the entire payment (total
        principal vs. total interest payments). The total of all loan
        installments shows the ratio of interest payments to the principal as a
        percentage. Along with a chart illustrating the interest and principal
        components paid each year, the payment schedule table displaying
        payments made each month or year for the loan term is presented. Each
        payment consists of a component for the principal balance and a portion
        for the interest. Each payment made during the first loan period
        includes a considerable portion of interest. As time goes on, more parts
        reduce the main. The payment plan also displays the carryover amount for
        each year's intermediate unpaid debt.

      <p>It is used to figure out the EMI for a home.</p>
      <p>
        Home loans often include a substantial loan principal and a lengthy
        term. Therefore, for its repayment, careful planning is necessary. To
        figure out your EMI, utilize Groww's home loan EMI calculator. It is an
        easy-to-use calculator that you can use right now to estimate and
        calculate your home loan EMIs. The answers will be calculated
        immediately once you enter your loan amount, loan tenure, and interest
        rate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most people take out personal loans to cover various needs, including
        unexpected medical expenses, trips, relocation, weddings, home
        renovations, etc. However, they have a substantially higher rate of
        interest and a shorter term because they are unsecured loans. To
        determine the loan and EMI quantity that you can comfortably pay, use
        Personal Loan EMI Calculator. You may determine your EMI by inputting
        the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider borrowing Rs. 5 lakh at an interest rate of 10.5 percent for
        personal needs with a 5-year repayment plan. Your monthly obligation
        will be Rs 10,747, as the calculator will demonstrate.

      <p>
        One of the biggest purchases somebody can make is an automobile.
        Therefore, you could need a vehicle loan to pay for this significant
        expenditure. Frequently, the EMI for a vehicle loan must be paid back to
        the lender within a certain amount of time, together with the required
        interest. If you don't pay the remaining sum, your automobile can be
        taken away and sold at auction. So, you may use a Car Loan EMI
        Calculator to get a specific EMI amount you can afford to pay easily.
        You may receive your monthly EMI amount by entering your interest rate,
        loan amount, and loan tenure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: You borrow Rs. 8 lakh for a car, and the bank's interest rate
        is 8.9%. You may use the calculator to determine that your EMI, for an
        8-year payback period, will be Rs 11,679.

        Factors Affecting the Amount You Owe
      </h2>
      <p>
        When preparing to apply for a loan, remember a few things. You will need
        to determine equal monthly installments based on your financial
        situation and ability to repay the loan (EMI). Here are a few points to
        consider:
      </p>
      <h3 class="font-heading text-1xl font-bold leading-normal text-primary">
        The Loan's Term
      </h3>
      <p>
        The length of a loan may be shortened or increased. There will then be a
        change in the EMI amount, either up or down. As a result, considering a
        loan's length is another crucial consideration that might impact the
        amount you owe.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-heading text-1xl font-bold leading-normal text-primary">
        Interest Rate
      </h3>
      <p>
        The real interest rate is a crucial element that will aid in determining
        the total amount of installments due. Therefore, you can evaluate the
        products and choose one with a lower interest rate so that your entire
        payments stay low.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-heading text-1xl font-bold leading-normal text-primary">
        Loan Amount
      </h3>
      <p>
        Another important aspect of choosing your loan amount is how it will
        affect your EMI. Your equivalent monthly payment will depend on the loan
        balance you select.
      </p>
      <p>The installment can be determined appropriately.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
    <div class="w-full max-w-lg text-justify">
      <h2 class="font-heading text-2xl font-bold leading-normal text-primary">
        What happens if the interest rate decreases or rises during your
        outstanding loan?
      </h2>
      <p>
        If your loan has a variable rate and the interest rate drops while it is
        being paid, a larger amount is added to the principal portion, and the
        loan will be paid back sooner.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, when the interest rate rises, the opposite occurs,
        meaning that a larger part is shifted toward the interest amount than
        the principle. If the EMI is maintained constant, this might result in a
        little change in the loan term.

        Calculation of the Floating Rate EMI
      </h2>
      <p>
        According to our advice, the two opposing scenarios—optimistic
        (deflationary) and pessimistic (inflationary)—should be taken into
        account when calculating floating/variable rate EMI. You have control
        over the loan balance and term, two factors needed to compute the EMI.
        You will choose how much money you need to borrow and how long your loan
        term should be. However, banks rely on their interest rate decisions on
        the rates and guidelines established by RBI. Therefore, you should
        estimate your EMI under such two scenarios as a borrower and consider
        the two extreme scenarios of a rise and a drop in the rate of interest.
        You may use this method to determine your loan's appropriate term,
        reasonable EMI, and balance.
      </p>
      <h3 class="font-heading text-1xl font-bold leading-normal text-primary">
        Optimistic (deflationary) scenario:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Imagine that the interest rate decreases from its current level by 1% to
        3%. Calculate your EMI taking this circumstance into account. Your EMI
        will decrease in this case, or you might choose to reduce the loan's
        term. For instance, a positive situation allows you to compare buying a
        property as an investment
      </p>
      <h3 class="font-heading text-1xl font-bold leading-normal text-primary">
        Pessimistic scenario: (inflationary):
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the same way, assume that the interest rate is hiked by 1% - 3%. Is
        it possible for you to keep paying the EMI without much struggle? Even a
        2% increase in the rate of interest can result in a significant rise in
        your monthly payment for the entire loan period. Such calculation helps
        you to plan for such future possibilities. When you take out a loan, you
        make a financial commitment for the next few months, years, or decades.
        So consider the best and worst case and be ready for both. In short,
        hope for the best but be prepared for the worst!

      <h2 class="font-heading text-2xl font-bold leading-normal text-primary">
        What happens if you pay off a portion of the loan early?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The initial loan tenure would shorten, or you would repay your loan
        earlier if you partially pay it during its loan term and choose not to
        adjust your future EMIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, because you only partially prepay, your loan duration won't
        alter if you opt to lower your upcoming EMIs.

        What occurs if you don't pay your EMI?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The loan's duration would lengthen if you skipped an EMI because of an
        inadequate amount or for any other reason, providing that the EMIs
        remained the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that missing EMIs might lower your credit score and not reflect
        positively on your creditworthiness. Therefore, ensure that you borrow
        sensibly and within your means to protect your financial wellness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The RBI's declaration of a moratorium has five key components you should
        be aware of.
      </p>
      <p>A moratorium is a sanction that allows debtors to delay payment.</p>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Even if you're delaying payments, you still have to make
          them.</strong
        >
        This is not a waiver, so keep that in mind. It's only a postponement.
        Even if you don't have to pay for three months, you'll eventually have
        to, so you're only postponing the inevitable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>It will cost you money.</strong> You will be charged interest if
        you use the moratorium to put off your payments. This interest will
        accumulate during that time and be due whenever you resume making
        payments. Although not debilitating, the interest is nevertheless not
        negligibly little. More interest simply means that your pocket will lose
        more money.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>You'll ultimately lose rewards.</strong> If you take advantage
        of the moratorium, you will forfeit any cashback incentives or 0%
        interest you depend on to make ends meet. Right, the whole goal of
        paying with an EMI is to save more rather than to spend more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The term of your loan is prolonged.</strong> If you take
        advantage of the moratorium, you will have to pay three months' worth of
        EMI payments and the additional interest assessed. The other option is
        to continue making payments, as you are already doing, and complete
        paying back your EMIs as originally intended. This gives you better
        control over your financial condition, especially because COVID-19's
        effects are still somewhat speculative.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>You are participating.</strong> In an emergency, it's normal to
        prioritize your own house, but we shouldn't overlook how this lockdown
        will affect millions of others throughout the nation. Regardless of the
        receiver, every contribution you make injects much-needed money into the
        economy and provides the stability we can all use now.

      <p>Five prevalent myths exposed about EMIs!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
    <div class="w-full max-w-lg text-justify">
      <h2 class="font-heading text-2xl font-bold leading-normal text-primary">
        Is a thing called "No-Cost EMI" actually a reality?
      </h2>
      <p>
        People's misconception that such a notion exists is the largest myth
        surrounding No-Cost EMIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of No-Cost or Zero-Cost EMIs was declared invalid by the
        Reserve Bank of India in the 2013 circular.
      </p>
      <p>
        The circular had stated that "the interest portion is often concealed
        and passed on to the client in the shape of processing charge" in the 0
        % tax EMI plans given on credit card balances.
      </p>
      <h3 class="font-heading text-1xl font-bold leading-normal text-primary">
        In reality, a no-cost EMI has interest.
      </h3>
      <p>
        No-Cost EMIs, according to experts, feature rates of interest of 15–24
        percent that are frequently not paid by users.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, online retailers provide customers a discount or rebate on
        the real interest amount.
      </p>
      <p>
        E-commerce companies pay the reduced amount (real interest) to the
        lenders, although customers often pay the product's original price with
        discounts or rebates and no processing fees.
      </p>
      <h3 class="font-heading text-1xl font-bold leading-normal text-primary">
        Items with No-Cost EMI offers cost less than comparable products.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Another method that No-Cost EMIs function is to include the real cost of
        the interest in the product's price; offline sellers typically do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this instance, clients wind up paying far more for a product than
        they would have if they had paid the whole amount up front.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the product producers occasionally bear the expense of
        Zero-Cost EMIs.
      </p>
      <h3 class="font-heading text-1xl font-bold leading-normal text-primary">
        Customers believe they can obtain No-Cost EMIs for any purchase.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Manufacturers or merchants that wish to promote their goods or move
        inventory quickly may use zero-cost EMI loan offers as part of their
        marketing or sales promotion strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, these programs are not available for all items but a limited
        number of companies and products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all products are eligible for no-cost EMI loans; typically, these
        deals are only available on pricey, higher-end products.
      </p>
      <h3 class="font-heading text-1xl font-bold leading-normal text-primary">
        No-Cost, Zero-Interest Repayment Terms are flexible and cost-effective.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Since most banks, credit card companies, or financiers offering these
        plans have a maximum payback length of 12 months, no-cost EMI loans
        aren't always an inexpensive alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even for highly expensive products, the payback period might
        occasionally be as short as three months. As a result, consumers must
        pay larger EMIs. In addition, customers may occasionally be requested to
        submit a down payment.

        The finest loans are those with short-term.
      </h3>
      <p>
        One common home loan fallacy is that choosing a loan with quite a
        shorter payback period is preferable. You must, however, pay more as
        Equated Monthly Installments due to the shorter term (EMIs). Therefore,
        weighing your alternatives and choosing the duration and EMI amount most
        appropriate for your requirements is essential.

        Foreclosure and early repayment carry severe consequences.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Another myth about house loans is that if a borrower wants to foreclose
        or pay back their debt, banks or other financial companies that supply
        loans also impose severe penalties. This is false according to RBI
        regulations, which indicate that no fees can be applied to foreclosures
        or prepayment for housing loans with fluctuating interest rates. But on
        house loans with fixed interest rates, which can again vary between
        institutions, institutions may decide to impose these fees. This is why
        it's crucial to comprehend the many fees connected to your mortgage
        rather than just concentrating on the interest rate.

        circumstances if you pay your payments on time, and you'll get the
        finest EMI perks.
