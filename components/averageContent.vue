        How to Calculate Average
      </h2>
      <p>
        The internet has many different types of calculators that we can use.
        They help us with simple and complex calculations. Most of us make use
        of such calculators. This is because while we know basic math, there
        comes a certain point past which we find it difficult to do the
        calculations manually.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most common types of mathematical calculation is to find the
        average..

        Average Calculator
      </h2>
      <p>
        In our day-to-day life we use the word “average” very often. In common
        language, the word refers to a number that represents a larger group.
        For example, we could say “The average number of students in the
        classroom is 26”. We could also say something like “On average, I eat an
        ice-cream once every 5 days”. In our daily life, we could have
        calculated the average like in the case of the students where we would
        have calculated the number of students in each class and the number of
        classes to find the average. However, very often, we just estimate it by
        making assumptions like in the case of the ice-cream. This is because we
        couldn’t really keep track of all the days we eat an ice-cream.
      </p>

      <p>
        When it comes to math, average is a more specific term. We cannot use
        the word loosely. In mathematics, for something to be considered an
        average, we need to make calculations to determine it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most common type of average in math is the “mean”. However, there
        are other types of averages. They include median, mode and geometric
        mean. The average calculator helps us

        Mean
      </h2>
      This is also called the “arithmetic mean”. It refers to the average value
      of all the numbers involved. Most often when we use the word average in
      our daily language, we refer to the arithmetic mean.

        How to Calculate Mean
      </h2>
      <p>
        We can find the mean by dividing the sum total of all the values by the
        number of values given. For example, if you have the numbers 15, 35, 65
        and 85. The mean of these numbers is 50. We get this by adding all the
        numbers and then dividing the sum by the number of values. That is,
        15+35+65+85 = 200. Since there are 4 values here (15, 35, 65, 85) we
        divide 200 by 4 and we get 50.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, if there are 4 values – a, b, c and d, the formula to find the
        mean is: a+b+c+dn. In this case n = 4.

        Real-life example of the use of Mean
      </h3>
      <p>
        A real-life example of the use of mean would be to calculate the scores
        of your favourite sportsperson. For example, if Virat Kohli has scored
        109, 28, 57, 135, 37 and 9 runs in his last 6 innings, then we can find
        out that on average he has scored 109+28+57+135+37+96 = 3756 = 62.5 runs
        in his last 6 innings.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mean of a given set of numbers does not have to be a whole number.
        That is, it can be in decimals as well. Thus, while you can have the
        mean of data sets as 23 or 68, the mean of other data sets could be
        5.433 or 986.987 as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Further, the mean of a given set of numbers does not need to be included
        within the set of numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, the mean of 5, 105, 65, 90 and 45 is 5+105+65+90+455 = 62.
        Here, 62 is not in the set of numbers given to us originally.

        Median
      </h2>
      Median refers to the middle value in a set of numbers. This middle value
      is found by arranging the numbers in ascending order and then locating the
      value at the centre.
    </div>

        How to Calculate Median
      </h2>
      <p>
        For example, if we have the numbers 1, 3, 5, 9, 2, 6 and 1, then the
        middle value here is 9. But 9 is not the median. We first arrange the
        numbers in ascending order. We get 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 9. Now we see
        that the middle value is 3. Hence 3 is the median.
      </p>

      <p>
        The formula to find the median depends on whether the number of values
        is even or odd. If the number of values is odd, then the formula for
        median is the value for the number positioned at the (n+12)th position.
        Like in the above example, there are 7 (odd number) values. Thus, the
        median is at the (7+12)th = 4th position. This is how we get 3 as the
        median value.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the number of values is even, then since there is no one number that
        is clearly in the middle, we take the mean of the two middle numbers.
        Thus, the formula here is the value we get by taking the mean of the
        numbers at the positions of (n2) and the (n2+1)th position.

        Real-life example of the use of Median
      </h2>
      <p>
        For example, if the data set has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 8, 8, 9
        and 9. The median here is the mean of the numbers at the (102) th = 5th
        position and (n2+1)th = 6th position. That is the mean of 4 and 5 which
        is (4+52) = 4.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to write the whole formula for the median of a data set when
        there are an even number of values is: (n2th+n2+1th2)
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike the mean, the median of a data set is always present in the data
        set when t he number of values is odd. However, when the number of
        values given are even, the median of the data set may or may not be
        within the set of numbers given.

        Mode
      </h2>
      <p>
        Mode is another type of average that is used in mathematics. A mode
        refers to the most common value in a data set. Unlike mean and median,
        finding the mode does not require too many calculations.

        How to Calculate Mode
      </h2>
      <p>
        You just have to recognize the number that repeats most often in the
        data set. For example, if the values are 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 3, 8, 4, 3,
        5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 0, 1, 6 and 9, then the number 3 appears 4 times, which
        is the most number of times any number appears here. Hence 3 is the
        mode.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even if a number is present only twice in the data set, it can still be
        the mode provided, no other number occurs more frequently than it. For
        example, if you have the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8 and 9. 7
        occurs twice while all other numbers are only present once. Hence, 7 is
        the mode here.
      </p>

      <p>
        A data set could also have multiple modes. For example, if you have the
        numbers 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5 and 6, the number 1 is repeated 3
        times which is the most. However, the number 5 is also repeated 3 times.
        Hence, this data set has two modes. Here, 1 and 5 are the modes.
      </p>
      This is called a bimodal data set.Unlike the mean of a data set, the mode
      of a data set is always present within the numbers given.

        Geometric Mean
      </h2>
      <p>
        The geometric mean of a set of numbers is calculated by multiplying all
        the numbers in the set and then taking the root of the set to the nth
        power; where n is the number of values. The calculation for geometric
        mean is relatively more difficult than the calculation for mean, median
        or mode. This is because to calculate the geometric mean, we need to
        take the root till the nth power.

        How to Calculate Geometric Mean
      </h2>
      <p>
        For example, if the values are 4, 6, 13, 19 and 22 then the geometric
        mean would be 54×6×13×19×22 = 10.545.
      </p>

      <p>
        The geometric mean is used mainly to calculate interest and growth
        rates. For example, if a stock grows by 10% in year one, declines by 20%
        in the second year, and then grows by 30% in the third year, then the
        growth rate can be calculated by finding the geometric mean of the data.
        The geometric mean of the growth rate is calculated as:
      </p>

      <p>(3(1+0.1)(1-0.2)(1+0.3)) = (31.10.81.3) = 1.046</p>

      <p>
        Since the value has grown from 1 to 1.046, it means that the value has
        grown by 1.046 – 1 = 0.046.
      </p>

      <p>
        0.046 is the equivalent of 4.6%. Hence, the annual growth rate of the
        stock is 4.6%.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like with arithmetic mean, the geometric mean of a data set does
        not have to be present in the numbers within the data set.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, the arithmetic mean will not always be equal to the
        geometric mean. However, even though the values of the arithmetic mean
        and geometric mean are not exactly the same, they are similar.

      Even though this is not really a type of average, the average calculator
      gives you the range of the values you have. The range refers to the value
      you get by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value of the
      data set.

      </p>

      <p>
        The range helps you understand the variability of the data you have.
        That is it helps you understand how exact or specific your data is. One
        of the most common places where the range is used is while predicting
        rainfall patterns. For example, the weather forecast may predict 65-75
        mm of rainfall in Chennai while predicting 55-60 mm of rainfall in
        Kolkata.

        Suppose a company A has a board game that it manufactures, it then
        decides to send 2 groups out to test the success. If group 1 comes back
        saying that children from the ages 5 to 16 like it most, then 16-5 = 9
        years is your range. However, if group B comes back and says that they
        asked everyone from the ages 5 to 50 about the game and got a positive
        review, then the range here is 50-5 = 45 years. Here we can see that
        group 1 has a smaller range and this seems more correct. Hence in most
        cases, smaller the range, more exact is the data.
