        The universe is a vast expanse of space and time. We constantly try to
        learn more about the universe and make sense of it. Yet, our knowledge
        of the universe is far lesser than what we don’t know about it. However,
        among the few things we know is that there are some constants. The first
        is change; the Greek philosopher, Heraclitus of Ephesus, said – “the
        only constant in life is change”. Change takes place naturally, or we
        bring it about. Therefore, things today are not the same as they were
        ten years ago. Similarly, things were different ten years ago from how
        they were 20 years ago.

        can only understand it. Time is an artificial construct. That is, even
        though we did not "invent" time. We have recognized it and given it
        meaning. This construct comes from man's need to make sense of
        everything around us. Keeping track of time has helped us immensely. It
        has given us schedules to follow and deadlines to keep up with. Another
        side-effect of time is age. We as humans have recognized that as time
        passes, we and the things around us age.

        is because the human mind can complete only a limited number of tasks
        and up to a certain level of complexity. However, we can also try

        We get this data with the help of “Age Calculators”. These age
        calculators help us calculate our age. All we have to do is enter our
        birth year, birth month and birthday. The algorithm then does the rest
        for us. Within a few seconds, we have our age on the screen. People can
        use age calculators to determine anyone's age as long as we know their
        date of birth. For example, if I type my date of birth as 23rd February
        1996 on an age calculator, I get the data that I am 26 years, four
        months and eight days as of 1st July 2022. Further, I can also get my

        In this example, the calculator counted all the days between the two
        dates I entered. It then gave me the number of days between those two
        dates. Since there are many units of time, multiple units can be used to
        describe the same amount of time. For example, 1 day = 24 hours. Here I
        have used two units of time - day and hours to describe the same amount
        of time. The calculator does this and then gives us the corresponding
        amount of time in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and
        years.

          Most calculators use the western age system to calculate one’s age.
          That is, it follows the assumption that the person will turn one year
          only after they reach their birthday the next year. According to this
          system, a person born on 10th January 2014 will turn one year old on
          10th January 2015. Then, every year they reach 10th January, they will
          be one year older. Hence, they will be ten years old as of 10th
          January 2024, 25 years old as of 10th January 2039 and so on.
        </p>
        <p class="py-3">
          This is the most common way to calculate age and is used universally.
          Hence, online age calculators use this method to calculate one's age.
          However, different cultures have different ways of calculating one's
          age. For example, in Chinese and Korean cultures, a person is one year
          old the day they are born. In Chinese culture, the person turns a year
          older on the day of the Chinese New Year rather than the day they were
          born.

          For example, if one were born just one day before the Chinese New
          Year, two days later, the baby would be two years old, even though the
          baby is only two days old. Similarly, Koreans count themselves one
          year older every Korean New Year. Hence, a baby born one day before
          the Korean New Year will be two years old on the day of the Korean New
          Year.

      <div class="w-full max-w-xl text-justify">
        <p>
          This kind of calculator helps one calculate their equivalent age in
          dog years. That is, it shows us the age a dog would have to reach to
          be as old as we are in human years. It also works the other way
          around. That shows us how old a given dog would be in human years.
        </p>
        <p class="py-3">
          While the usual rule is multiplying the dog's age by 7, that is not
          how a dog ages. Dogs age faster in their first two years, after which
          their ageing process slows down. These calculators take such factors
          into account and then give us the equivalent age. Some more
          sophisticated calculators also consider the dog's breed while
          calculating the dog's age in human years. For example, a 12-year-old
          Beagle would be 64 in human years. On the other hand, a 12-year-old
          bulldog would be 75 in human years.

          A Planetary Age Calculator helps one calculate their age if they were
          on a different planet. For example, on Earth, we age by one year every
          time we pass our birthday. One year on Earth is the time it takes to
          complete one full revolution around the sun. Therefore planetary age
          calculators assume that we would age one year for every one revolution
          of the given planet around the sun.

        <p class="py-3">
          Hence, by that logic, a 55-year-old on Earth would be 228.36 years on
          Mercury, 89.4 years on Venus, 29.24 years on Mars, 4.64 years on
          Jupiter, 1.87 years on Saturn, 0.65 years on Uranus and 0.33 years on
          Neptune.

        <p class="py-3">
          This means that for the 55-year-old, the Earth will have revolved 55

          revolved 228.36 times, and Venus will have revolved 89.4 times around
          the sun. Similarly, Mars would have completed 29.24 revolutions, and
          Jupiter would have completed 4.64 revolutions around the sun. At the
          same time, Saturn would have revolved 1.87 times while Uranus and

          These types of age calculators help us calculate our age based on
          eating, sleeping, drinking and other habits. It takes into
          consideration our lifestyle and then provides us with a number that
          signifies how much our body has aged based on our habits. Some age
          calculators ask questions regarding our habits and lifestyle and then,
          based on our answers, give us our relative age. On the other hand,
          other calculators make us do a bit more manual work. These calculators
          have MCQs about our habits, and each answer is assigned a particular
          value. Ultimately, we tally the score and then add or subtract it from
          our age to determine our relative age.

          This age calculator is based on the short story “The Curious Case of
          Benjamin Button”. In the story, Benjamin Button is a boy who is born
          looking like he is a 70-year-old man. As he ages, he starts to look
          younger and younger, with his body behaving similarly. Taking this
          into account, this calculator calculates our ages backwards. We take
          our age and then subtract it from 70. Hence by this logic, a
          22-year-old would be 48 years old while a 50-year-old would be 20
          years old.

          This age calculator is based on details mentioned in the Bible. The
          Bible mentions people living up to over 900 years of age. However, the
          popular theory is that over the years, during the course of
          translation, the ages that were mentioned in the Bible were according
          to lunar cycles. Hence, according to the solar calendar, someone who
          would have been 964 lunar cycles old would only be 78 years old. Thus
          these age calculators convert our age into lunar months and give us a
          value.

          This age calculator is based on the novel "The Picture of Dorian
          Grey". In the book, Dorian Grey realizes that his youth will not last
          forever. So, to keep his youth and beauty, he sells his soul to avoid
          ageing. So instead of his body ageing, a portrait of him ages. This
          calculator merely asks you your age and the age at which “you sold
          your soul”. It then provides you with your current age.
