          concepts. However, math is still a very vital subject and it plays a
          huge role in our daily life. Every day, we use mathematics in some or
          the other way. We could use it while sitting in a boring lecture to
          count down the hours left for school to end or we could use it to
          calculate how much we need to pay the shopkeeper for our groceries.
        </div>
        <div class="py-2">
          We could also use it to calculate our results at the end of the
          academic year or to even budget our finances. While some of the
          calculations are easy, others may not necessarily be easy. This is
          where something like percentage calculator comes in.
        </div>
        <div class="py-2">
          For example, if we buy two 1-litre bottles of water from a shop, it’s
          easy to calculate that we need to pay the shopkeeper 2×20=40 rupees.
          However, if we go to the shopping mart to buy groceries for the month,
          it will not be easy to calculate the total amount we need to pay for
          all the things we buy.
        </div>
        <div class="py-2">
          Similarly, it might be easy to calculate the number of marks we get in
          one test by adding all the marks we have got for each question.
          However, it might be difficult to calculate the total percentage we
          have got while considering all the papers we have attempted.

        <div class="py-2">
          Therefore, the internet has many different types of calculators that
          we can use. They help us with simple and complex calculations. Most of
          us make use of such calculators. This is because while we know basic
          math, there comes a certain point past which we find it difficult to
          do the calculations manually.

        In mathematics, “percentage” is a number or ratio that represents a
        fraction of 100. It is often denoted by the symbol %. Since it
        represents a fraction of 100, the “%” symbol can simply be swapped out
        by dividing the number by 100. Hence, 80% is the same as 0.8. Thus, 80%
        of 100 = 0.8×100 = 80

        This is the most basic use of a percentage calculator. We often need to
        use this function to find out information that could be useful to us.
        For example, if we need 90% in our final paper to get an A grade, then
        we can use this feature to find out the marks we need.

        Taking the above example, if you need to score 90% on your final paper,
        and the total marks of the paper is 70 marks, then you can use the
        calculator to find the marks you need. On entering 90% of 70, the
        calculator tells you that the answer to this is 63. Hence, you need 63
        marks to get 90% on this paper.

        This can be used to find the percentage increase or decrease between two
        numbers. For example, you can use it to find out the percentage increase
        in the population of a town when the population increases from 5,000 in
        2010 to 7,000 people in 2020.

        Taking the above example, we see that there is an increase, so we need

        is a 40% increase on 5000. Hence, the town’s population has increased by
        40% from 2010 to 2020.
